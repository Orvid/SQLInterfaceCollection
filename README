This is a universal interface for many types of databases, it currently supports the following types of databases:

1. BerklyDB
2. DB2
3. Db4o
4. FirebirdSQL
5. HyperNetDB
6. MySql
7. NeoDatis
8. PostgreSQL
9. SQLite

Each of the database types is supported by a single (Integrated) dll, except for SQLite, which has 3 choices of backends. These choices are:

1. System.Data.SQLite
2. Mono.Data.SQLite
3. Community.CSharp.SQLite

All of the namespaces match up to their original locations, and shouldn't require any modification to your code. 

This library is written for .Net v3.5.
